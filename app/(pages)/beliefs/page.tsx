The scripture teaches that "sanctified" is what the believer is [not a process, but a state, which the believer has already entered into once and for all], and "perfect" is what he is expected to be. Perfection is a spiritual growth for those who have been sanctified and consecrated. Therefore it is the total yielding of one\'s life to the Holy Spirit, living the crucified life; being an overcomer; and being conformed to the image of Christ Himself. Perfection and true holiness are impossible without the indwelling of the Holy Spirit.
